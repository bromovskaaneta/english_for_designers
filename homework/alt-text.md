I also wrote a short original text (approximately 125–250 words) reflecting on my personal perspective on craft and design. I then created a typographic layout featuring my bespoke drop cap, carefully balancing the custom letterform with the body text. Attention was given to hierarchy, readability, line flow, and the use of white space. The final composition was designed in InDesign, combining written content with intentional typographic and visual design choices.
