# Handshake

## Task

The goal of the *Handshake* assignment is to practice clear and confident self-presentation, similar to a real-life first meeting or introduction.  
The task focuses on how we communicate who we are, what we do, and what value we bring — quickly, clearly, and without unnecessary explanation.

## Approach

I approached this task as a short personal communication exercise.  
I focused on clarity, tone, and intention rather than visual complexity, aiming to create a natural and honest first impression.

The main priorities were:
- simplicity and readability  
- confident but approachable tone  
- clear message without overloading information  

## Output

The output is a concise self-presentation that can work in different contexts — personal introduction, collaboration, or first professional contact.

*(Final output / visual / text version will be added here.)*

## Reflection

This assignment helped me realize how important structure and clarity are in even the shortest forms of communication.  
I learned how small wording changes can significantly affect the overall impression and how intentional communication builds trust from the very first moment.

## Next steps

- Refine wording based on feedback  
- Possibly adapt the format for different platforms (web / social / portfolio)
